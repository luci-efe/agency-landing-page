# Project Brief: [Nombre de la Empresa] Landing Page

## Executive Summary
This project is for the creation of a visually stunning and highly interactive landing page for a new Guadalajara-based Software Development Agency, `[Nombre de la Empresa]`. The page's primary purpose is to serve as a direct demonstration of the agency's elite capabilities, compelling potential clients to desire a similar quality of work for their own projects and generating inbound leads through a clear contact path. It addresses the challenge for local startups and small-to-medium businesses of finding an expert, trustworthy, and forward-thinking agency that specializes in exciting technological solutions, particularly those driven by AI. The key value proposition is the "wow factor" of the landing page itself; its design and interactivity are the primary message, establishing immediate credibility and showcasing the agency's commitment to quality.

## Problem Statement
For startups and small-to-medium businesses in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Zone, the process of establishing a credible and effective online presence is fraught with risk and frustration. Their goal is to find a digital partner who can translate business objectives into a high-quality website, but the current landscape presents significant challenges.

#### Key Client Pain Points:
* **Opaque and Prohibitive Costs:** Clients face ambiguous quotes and the constant fear of "scope creep," turning a potential investment into a financial black hole.
* **Glacial Timelines and Missed Opportunities:** Slow project delivery from existing providers causes businesses to miss crucial launch windows and lose market momentum.
* **The "Cookie-Cutter" Curse:** Many end up with generic, template-based websites that fail to capture their brand's unique essence, making them forgettable in a crowded market.
* **Paralysis and Lack of Guidance:** Business owners, who are experts in their own fields, are overwhelmed by the process and often don't know what to ask for, needing a strategic partner rather than a simple order-taker.

#### The Business Impact of a Mediocre Website:
A poor-quality website is a direct liability with severe, measurable consequences, including immediate customer loss, erosion of brand credibility, wasted marketing investment, operational inefficiency, and a technical inability to scale.

#### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:
The local market often fails because it treats websites as a commodity rather than a strategic business tool. The key missing element is a **Business-First, Tech-Second Partnership** that prioritizes solving the client's core business problem.

## Proposed Solution
#### Core Concept and Approach
The solution is to create an immersive, single-page digital experience that functions as a "living portfolio." The core concept is a visually stunning and highly interactive landing page, primarily in Spanish with an English language option, that immediately demonstrates the agency's elite capabilities. Key features will include an interactive 3D service showcase and real-time personalization options (such as color palette changes).

#### Key Differentiators from Existing Solutions
* **Demonstrable Excellence:** Unlike competitors who rely on static portfolios, this landing page's interactivity and modern aesthetic will serve as a direct, tangible demonstration of the agency's expertise.
* **Rapid, High-Quality Delivery:** Leveraging extensive experience in modern web tools, project management, and development, the agency will deliver best-in-class results in compressed timelines.
* **Strategic Partnership:** Moving beyond the "order-taker" model, the agency acts as a consultative partner, focusing on solving core business problems.

#### Why This Solution Will Succeed
This approach will succeed because it directly addresses the primary pain points of the target market. The engaging, modern, and interactive user experience will immediately build brand credibility and trust, making potential clients desire a similar, high-quality product for themselves.

#### High-Level Vision for the Product
The landing page will serve as the agency's primary "front door"â€”a powerful tool for generating leads and establishing brand prestige. The architecture will be designed with scalability in mind, allowing for future expansion.

## Target Users
#### Primary User Segment: The Non-Technical Founder/CEO
* **Profile:** The leader of a local startup or SMB, expert in their own industry but not in technology. They are visionary, budget-conscious, and short on time.

#### Secondary User Segment: The Marketing Manager
* **Profile:** Works within a local SMB and is responsible for growth and lead generation, measured by tangible results and KPIs.
* **Needs & Pain Points:** Their main frustration is with websites that are ineffective marketing tools (high bounce rates, low conversions). They need a website that is an asset, not a liability.

#### Technology Preferences
* **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and Spline.
* **Backend:** Next.js integrated backend capabilities.
* **Database:** Supabase.
* **Hosting/Infrastructure:** Host on Vercel, with Cloudflare for DNS, CDN, and security.

#### Architecture Considerations
* **Repository Structure:** A single repository (monorepo).
* **Security:** Prioritize security by following OWASP Top 10 best practices, using regular dependency scanning, and ensuring a secure deployment pipeline.

## Constraints & Assumptions
#### Constraints
* **Budget:** $0 development budget; costs are only incurred upon deployment.
* **Timeline:** Flexible, with a focus on quality over a specific deadline.
* **Resources:** Initial MVP development will be executed by a single developer.

#### Key Assumptions
* The 3D elements are feasible within the project's resource constraints using tools like Spline.
* The free tiers of the selected cloud services (Vercel, Supabase, Cloudflare) are sufficient for the MVP.
* The developer has the necessary full-stack expertise for the project.

## Risks & Open Questions
#### Key Risks
* **Performance Risk:** Highly interactive features could slow down the site if not properly optimized.
* **Resource Risk:** The ambitious scope may be a heavy lift for a single developer.
* **Subjectivity of Design:** The "wow factor" is subjective and may not resonate with all target clients.

#### Open Questions
* What is the final marketing copy for the page?
* What is the detailed SEO strategy?

#### Areas Needing Further Research
* The most performant methods for integrating Spline with Next.js.
* Best practices for internationalization (i18n) in Next.js.

## Next Steps
#### PM Handoff
This Project Brief provides the full context for the [Nombre de la Empresa] Landing Page. The next step is to engage the Product Manager (PM) to create the Product Requirements Document (PRD). The PM should review this brief thoroughly and work with the user to create the PRD section by section, asking for any necessary clarification and suggesting improvements.

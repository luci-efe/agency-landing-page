# Story 1.3: Core Layout, Theme & Internationalization (i18n)

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement the main page layout, set up the Tailwind CSS theme, and integrate the internationalization library,

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A main layout component is created with placeholders for Header, Footer, and page content.
2. The `tailwind.config.js` file is configured with the primary fonts and color palette.
3. The `next-intl` library is integrated and a simple language switcher is functional.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

[Source: docs/stories/1.2.hosting-cicd-pipeline-foundation.md]

- Project is successfully deployed on Vercel with CI/CD pipeline
- React 19 compatibility is handled with --legacy-peer-deps
- Build verification passes (npm run build, npm run lint, npm run typecheck)

- **API Communication:** Dedicated service layer in `src/lib/api.ts` for all `fetch` calls

### Project Structure and File Locations

[Source: docs/architecture.md#12-unified-project-structure]
The project follows a standard Next.js monorepo structure with:

- `src/app/` - App Router pages and API routes
- `src/components/` - React components organized by: `features/`, `ui/`, `layout/`
- `src/lib/` - Services and utilities (`api.ts`, `database.ts`)
- `src/styles/` - Global styles and Tailwind configuration

### Tech Stack and Dependencies

[Source: docs/architecture.md#3-tech-stack]

### UI Design Goals and Branding

[Source: docs/prd.md#3-user-interface-design-goals]

- **Overall UX Vision:** Immersive, intuitive, and premium experience that feels like an interactive digital art piece
- **Target:** Evoke a "wow" response from visitors, building instant credibility
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive, providing tailored experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for highest quality standards
- **Branding:** Professional logo for `[Nombre de la Empresa]` will be created during design phase

### Layout Structure Requirements

[Source: docs/prd.md#48-core-screens-and-views]
Single-page application flow through distinct sections:

1. Hero View
2. Interactive Service Showcase
3. Value Proposition Section
4. Contact View

### Technical Constraints

[Source: docs/architecture.md#15-security-and-performance]

- **Performance:** Asset optimization, lazy loading strategies, code splitting
- **Security:** Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation required
- React 19 compatibility with legacy peer dependency handling
- Must maintain build compatibility with existing CI/CD pipeline

### Styling and Theme Configuration

[Source: docs/architecture.md#3-tech-stack]

- Tailwind CSS v4 is used (newer version than specified in architecture)
- PostCSS configuration already exists at `postcss.config.mjs`
- Global styles location: `src/styles/` directory
- Current global styles file: `src/app/globals.css`

### Development Workflow Integration

[Source: docs/architecture.md#13-development-workflow]

- **Local Setup:** Standard workflow: `git clone`, `npm install`, then run `npm run dev`
- **Environment Variables:** Configuration stored in `.env.local` file
- Development uses Turbopack for faster builds (`npm run dev --turbopack`)

## Testing

- Unit tests: `src/**/__tests__/` or `src/**/*.test.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}`
- E2E tests: `cypress/e2e/`

### Testing Standards

[Source: docs/architecture.md#16-testing-strategy]

- Use Jest ~29.7 with React Testing Library for unit/integration tests
- Use Cypress ~13.10 for end-to-end testing
- Follow the "Full Testing Pyramid" approach
- Test coverage should focus on business logic and user interactions

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns

# Story 1.2: Hosting & CI/CD Pipeline Foundation

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the hosting environments on Vercel and Cloudflare and establish a basic CI/CD pipeline,
**so that** any code pushed to the main branch is automatically deployed.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A new project is created on Vercel and linked to the Git repository.
2. Cloudflare is configured for DNS and to proxy traffic to the Vercel deployment.
3. A basic CI/CD workflow is created that automatically deploys the `main` branch.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Set up Vercel hosting project (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create new project on Vercel platform
  - [ ] Connect Git repository to Vercel project
  - [ ] Configure build settings (Next.js framework detection)
  - [ ] Verify initial deployment with current code
- [ ] Configure Cloudflare DNS and proxying (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Set up DNS records pointing to Vercel deployment
  - [ ] Configure Cloudflare proxy settings for CDN and security
  - [ ] Verify traffic routing through Cloudflare to Vercel
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment
  - [ ] Configure workflow to run linting and type checking on pushes
  - [ ] Set up automatic deployment on main branch pushes
  - [ ] Test CI/CD pipeline with a test commit
- [ ] Environment configuration and verification (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Set up environment variables in Vercel dashboard
  - [ ] Configure distinct environments (Development, Preview, Production)
  - [ ] Verify build and deployment process end-to-end

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

[Source: docs/stories/1.1.initial-project-setup.md]

- React 19 compatibility issues with 3D libraries resolved using --legacy-peer-deps
- All development tooling configured successfully: ESLint, Prettier, Jest, Cypress
- Project structure follows architecture specifications
- Build verification passes successfully (npm run build, npm run lint, npm run typecheck)
- Initial project foundation is stable and ready for deployment

### Platform and Infrastructure Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture.md#2-high-level-architecture]

- **Platform:** Vercel for hosting and serverless functions
- **Key Services:** Vercel for Next.js Hosting, Serverless Functions, and Edge Network; Cloudflare for DNS, CDN, and Security
- **Deployment Host and Regions:** Vercel's global edge network
- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo, managed via standard npm/yarn workspaces

### Deployment Architecture

[Source: docs/architecture.md#14-deployment-architecture]

- **Strategy:** Git-based, continuous deployment strategy via Vercel's Git integration
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions workflow will run linting and testing on every push and pull request
- **Environments:** Distinct environments for Development (localhost), Preview (Vercel PR deployments), and Production

### Security and Performance Considerations

[Source: docs/architecture.md#15-security-and-performance]

- **Security:** Includes Content Security Policy (CSP), server-side input validation, rate limiting, and secure management of secret keys
- **Performance:** Strategies include asset optimization, lazy loading for the 3D scene, code splitting, and leveraging Vercel's Edge CDN

### Environment Configuration

[Source: docs/architecture.md#13-development-workflow]

- **Environment Variables:** Configuration for Supabase keys will be stored in a `.env.local` file
- **Local Setup:** Standard workflow: `git clone`, `npm install`, then run `npm run dev`

### Architectural Patterns

[Source: docs/architecture.md#2-high-level-architecture]

- **Jamstack:** The core of the site will be pre-rendered into static files
- **Serverless Functions:** Next.js API Routes for backend logic, which eliminates server management and scales automatically
- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** The primary rendering strategy will be SSG to provide the fastest possible load times

### File Locations and Structure

[Source: docs/architecture.md#12-unified-project-structure]
The project follows a standard Next.js monorepo structure with:

- `src/app/` - App Router pages and API routes
- `src/components/` - React components organized by: `features/`, `ui/`, `layout/`
- `src/lib/` - Services and utilities (`api.ts`, `database.ts`)
- `src/styles/` - Global styles and Tailwind configuration

### Technical Constraints

- Must operate entirely within the free tiers of Vercel and Cloudflare services for the MVP phase
- Build process must support React 19 with legacy peer dependency handling
- CI/CD pipeline must include linting (ESLint ~9.3) and type checking (TypeScript ~5.5)

## Testing

### Test File Locations

[Source: docs/stories/1.1.initial-project-setup.md]

- Unit tests: `src/**/__tests__/` or `src/**/*.test.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}`
- E2E tests: `cypress/e2e/`

### Testing Standards

[Source: docs/architecture.md#16-testing-strategy]

- Use Jest with React Testing Library for unit/integration tests
- Use Cypress for end-to-end testing
- Follow the "Full Testing Pyramid" approach
- GitHub Actions workflow will run linting and testing on every push and pull request

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns

[Source: docs/stories/1.1.initial-project-setup.md]

- **Unit/Integration:** Jest ~29.7 with React Testing Library
- **E2E:** Cypress ~13.10
- Test coverage should focus on business logic and user interactions

### Specific Testing Requirements

- CI/CD pipeline must include automated testing on every push
- Verify deployment process doesn't break existing functionality
- Ensure all npm scripts (build, lint, typecheck) pass in CI environment
- Test end-to-end deployment flow from Git push to live deployment

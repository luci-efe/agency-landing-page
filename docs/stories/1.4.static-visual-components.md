## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

[Source: docs/stories/1.3.core-layout-theme-internationalization.md]

- MainLayout, Header, and Footer components are implemented and ready for content
- Tailwind v4 theme is configured with Inter font and indigo-based color palette
- next-intl internationalization is fully functional with Spanish/English support
- Layout structure is responsive and ready for section content integration
- All build, lint, and type-check processes are verified and working

### Frontend Architecture and Component Organization

[Source: docs/architecture.md#10-frontend-architecture]

- **Component Organization:** Feature-based directory structure (`src/components/features`, `ui`, `layout`)
- **State Management:** Local state via `useState` and minimal global state via `useContext`
- **API Communication:** Dedicated service layer in `src/lib/api.ts` for all `fetch` calls

### Project Structure and File Locations

[Source: docs/architecture.md#12-unified-project-structure]
The project follows a standard Next.js monorepo structure with:

- `src/app/` - App Router pages and API routes
- `src/components/` - React components organized by: `features/`, `ui/`, `layout/`
- `src/lib/` - Services and utilities (`api.ts`, `database.ts`)
- `src/styles/` - Global styles and Tailwind configuration

### Tech Stack and Dependencies

[Source: docs/architecture.md#3-tech-stack]

- **Frontend Language:** TypeScript ~5.5
- **Framework:** Next.js ~14.2 (currently using 15.4.4)
- **UI Library:** React ~18.3 (currently using 19.1.0)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS ~3.4 (currently using 4.0)
- **Headless UI:** Radix UI ~1.1 (already installed)
- **3D Rendering:** React Three Fiber ~8.16 (for future interactive scene)
- **Internationalization:** next-intl ~3.15 (currently using 3.26.5)

### UI Design Requirements

[Source: docs/prd.md#3-user-interface-design-goals]

- **Overall UX Vision:** Immersive, intuitive, and premium experience that feels like an interactive digital art piece
- **Target:** Evoke a "wow" response from visitors, building instant credibility
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive, providing tailored experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for highest quality standards
- **Branding:** Professional logo for `[Nombre de la Empresa]` will be created during design phase

### Core Screens and Views Structure

[Source: docs/prd.md#48-core-screens-and-views]
Single-page application flow through distinct sections:

1. **Hero View** - Visually stunning, animated hero section
2. **Interactive Service Showcase** - 3D scene placeholder with service information
3. **Value Proposition Section** - Agency capabilities and client success stories
4. **Contact View** - Lead capture form and contact information

### Key Interaction Paradigms for Static Implementation

[Source: docs/prd.md#3-user-interface-design-goals]

- **Scroll-driven Storytelling:** As the user scrolls, animations will reveal content sections in a smooth, narrative-driven way
- **Responsive Micro-interactions:** All interactive elements will provide immediate visual feedback on hover and focus states
- **Direct 3D Manipulation:** Placeholder for future 3D scene (static image/render for now)
- **Real-time Personalization:** Placeholder UI controls for future color scheme changes

### Functional Requirements for Static Implementation

[Source: docs/prd.md#2-requirements]

- **FR1:** The system must display a visually stunning, animated hero section upon initial page load
- **FR2:** Static placeholder where interactive 3D scene will be implemented in Epic 2
- **FR5:** Contact form UI that captures user data fields (non-functional for now)
- **FR6:** Fully responsive UI adapting to desktop, tablet, and mobile viewport sizes
- **FR7:** Support content in both Spanish and English using existing i18n setup

### Technical Constraints

[Source: docs/architecture.md#15-security-and-performance]

- **Performance:** Asset optimization, lazy loading strategies, code splitting
- **Security:** Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation required
- React 19 compatibility with legacy peer dependency handling
- Must maintain build compatibility with existing CI/CD pipeline

### Styling and Theme Integration

[Source: docs/stories/1.3.core-layout-theme-internationalization.md]

- Tailwind v4 is configured with inline @theme syntax
- Custom color palette: indigo-based primary colors (50-950 spectrum)
- Inter font is set as primary typography
- Responsive breakpoints and custom spacing scale are configured
- Global styles location: `src/app/globals.css`

### Internationalization Integration

[Source: docs/stories/1.3.core-layout-theme-internationalization.md]

- next-intl middleware is configured for locale detection (es/en)
- Translation files exist at `messages/es.json` and `messages/en.json`
- Locale-based routing structure: `/es` and `/en` paths
- Use `useTranslations()` hook for component text content
- Language switcher component already exists in Header

### Component Architecture Patterns

[Source: docs/stories/1.3.core-layout-theme-internationalization.md]

- All components are fully typed with TypeScript interfaces
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS classes
- Component files follow pattern: `ComponentName.tsx`
- Use React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for local state management
- Import translations with `useTranslations('sectionName')` pattern

# [Nombre de la Empresa] UI/UX Specification

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for the `[Nombre de la Empresa]`'s user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

#### Overall UX Goals & Principles
* **Target User Personas**
    * **The Non-Technical Founder/CEO:** Needs a clear, confidence-building experience that quickly demonstrates value and trustworthiness.
    * **The Marketing Manager:** Needs to see a polished, professional site that looks like an effective tool for lead generation.
* **Usability Goals**
    * **Rapid Comprehension:** A visitor must understand the agency's core value in under 90 seconds.
    * **Effortless Inquiry:** The process of contacting the agency should be simple and frictionless.
    * **Engaging Exploration:** The interactive elements should be intuitive and rewarding to use.
* **Design Principles**
    1. **Clarity in Motion:** Animations will guide the user and clarify content, not distract.
    2. **Delight in Discovery:** The page will reward curiosity and interaction.
    3. **Effortless Interaction:** All interactions will feel smooth, responsive, and intuitive on any device.

## 2. Information Architecture (IA)

#### Site Map / Section Flow
[Mermaid Diagram showing the section flow: Header -> Hero -> Interactive Service Showcase -> Value Proposition -> Contact -> Footer]

#### Navigation Structure
* **Primary Navigation:** A "sticky" navigation bar containing anchor links that smoothly scroll the user to the corresponding section. It will also contain the language switcher (ES/EN).
* **Secondary Navigation:** Not applicable for the MVP.
* **Breadcrumbs:** Not applicable for a single-page application.

## 3. User Flows

#### Flow: Service Discovery to Lead Conversion
* **User Goal:** "As a potential client, I want to quickly understand the agency's capabilities and, if I'm impressed, easily contact them for a consultation."
* **Entry Points:** Direct navigation, social media links, or Google search results.
* **Success Criteria:** The user successfully submits the contact form.
* **Flow Diagram:**

* **Edge Cases & Error Handling:**
    * **3D Scene Fails to Load:** A high-quality static placeholder will be displayed.
    * **Form Submission Fails:** A clear error message with an alternative contact method will appear.

## 4. Wireframes & Mockups

**Primary Design Files:** `[Link to Figma/Sketch/XD file - to be added]`

#### Key Screen Layouts
* **Hero Section:** Full-screen, minimalist layout with a strong focus on a bold, central headline and sub-headline over an animated background.
* **Interactive Service Showcase:** Dominated by the central 3D scene. UI is minimal to avoid distraction. Service information appears in an overlay (modal or side panel).
* **Contact Section:** A clean, two-column layout on desktop (text left, form right), which stacks to a single column on mobile.

## 5. Component Library / Design System

#### Design System Approach
A **"Headless + Tailwind"** strategy will be used. A headless component library (like Radix UI) will provide core functionality and accessibility, with all visual styling handled by Tailwind CSS for maximum design flexibility and development speed.

#### Core Components (MVP)
* **Button:** (Primary, Secondary variants; Default, hover, active states)
* **Navigation Header:** (Logo, Nav Links, Language Switcher)
* **Service Information Panel:** (Title, Description, Close Button; Visible/hidden states)
* **Input Field:** (Label, Text Input, Error Message; Default, focus, error states)

## 6. Branding & Style Guide

#### Visual Identity
* **Brand Guidelines:** This document serves as the foundational style guide.
* **Logo:** A logo for `[Nombre de la Empresa]` is required.

#### Color Palette
| Color Type      | Hex Code  | Usage                               |
| :-------------- | :-------- | :---------------------------------- |
| Background      | `#0A0A0A` | Main page background                |
| Primary Text    | `#EAEAEA` | Body copy and standard text         |
| Primary Accent  | `#8A2BE2` | CTAs, interactive highlights, glows |
| Secondary Accent| `#FFA500` | Secondary highlights, gradients     |
| Success         | `#22C55E` | Form submission success messages    |
| Error           | `#EF4444` | Form validation error messages      |
| Neutral         | `#333333` | Borders, card backgrounds           |

#### Typography
* **Font Families:** Primary font will be a clean, modern sans-serif like **Satoshi** or **Inter**.
* **Type Scale:** A responsive, modular type scale will be used for consistency, with large, bold headings.

## 7. Accessibility Requirements

* **Standard:** The website will adhere to the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA**.
* **Key Requirements:** This includes sufficient color contrast, full keyboard navigability, screen reader compatibility, and proper labeling for all interactive elements.
* **Testing:** A mix of automated (Lighthouse/Axe) and manual testing will be performed.

## 8. Responsiveness Strategy

* **Breakpoints:** A mobile-first approach using standard Tailwind CSS breakpoints (md, lg, xl) will be used.
* **Adaptation Patterns:** The layout will adapt from a single column on mobile to multi-column layouts on larger screens. Navigation will collapse into a "hamburger" menu on mobile.

## 9. Animation & Micro-interactions

* **Motion Principles:** Animations will be purposeful, smooth (60fps), and responsive to user input.
* **Key Animations:** Hero section reveal, scroll-based section transitions, 3D object hover effects, and button/link micro-interactions.

## 10. Performance Considerations

* **Performance Goals:** Interactive in <3s, interaction response <100ms, animations at 60fps.
* **Design Strategies:** Asset optimization, lazy loading of the 3D scene, code splitting, and use of static fallbacks.

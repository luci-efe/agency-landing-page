# [Nombre de la Empresa] Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**
* Create a visually stunning and interactive landing page that serves as a "living portfolio," demonstrating the agency's elite capabilities.
* Generate 5 qualified leads per month within 3 months of launch.
* Establish the brand as a top-tier, strategic web development partner in the Guadalajara area.

**Background Context:**
Local startups and SMBs in Guadalajara struggle to find trustworthy web partners who can deliver high-quality, modern websites without opaque costs and slow timelines. This project solves that problem by creating a landing page that is, in itself, a testament to the agency's quality, skill, and business-first approach. It will serve as the primary tool for building brand credibility and converting visitors into clients.

## 3. User Interface Design Goals

#### Overall UX Vision
The user experience will be immersive, intuitive, and premium. It should feel less like a traditional website and more like an interactive digital art piece. The primary goal is to evoke a "wow" response from visitors, building instant credibility and confidence in the agency's capabilities.

#### Key Interaction Paradigms
* **Direct 3D Manipulation:** Users will be able to directly interact with elements in the 3D scene to explore services.
* **Scroll-driven Storytelling:** As the user scrolls, animations will reveal content sections in a smooth, narrative-driven way.
* **Real-time Personalization:** Users will be able to engage with controls that change the page's aesthetic in real-time.
* **Responsive Micro-interactions:** All interactive elements will provide immediate visual feedback on hover and click.

#### Core Screens and Views
As a single-page application, the experience is defined by a flow through distinct sections:
1.  Hero View
2.  Interactive Service Showcase
3.  Value Proposition Section
4.  Contact View

#### Accessibility: WCAG AA
The site will adhere to the WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standard to ensure it is usable by people with disabilities, aligning with the goal of a "highest quality" product.

#### Branding
The site's visual identity will be established through this project, inspired by the provided examples (`hyperbolic.ai`, `firebase.studio`). A professional logo for `[Nombre de la Empresa]` will need to be created during the design phase.

#### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
The application will be fully responsive, providing a tailored and flawless experience on all modern desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## 4. Technical Assumptions

#### Repository Structure: Monorepo
The project will be developed within a single repository (monorepo) to streamline the management of the full-stack Next.js application.

#### Service Architecture: Monolith
The application will be built as a monolith, with all backend logic handled within the single Next.js application to prioritize development speed and simplicity for the MVP.

#### Testing Requirements: Full Testing Pyramid
A comprehensive testing strategy is required, including Unit Tests, Integration Tests, and End-to-End (E2E) Tests to ensure quality, security, and maintainability.

#### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
* The interactive 3D scene will be authored using **Spline** and integrated via **React Three Fiber**.
* The database will be **Supabase**.
* The hosting platform will be **Vercel**, with **Cloudflare** used for DNS, CDN, and security.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  The Header, Footer, Hero, and content sections are fully built and styled with placeholder content.
    2.  A static placeholder image or a non-interactive 3D render is present where the interactive service showcase will be.
    3.  The UI for the contact form is built but is not yet functional.

## Epic 2: Core Interactivity (Details)

**Expanded Goal:** This epic transforms the static visual foundation built in Epic 1 into the dynamic, engaging experience that defines the agency's "wow factor."

#### Story 2.4: Connect 3D Interaction to UI
* **As a** user, **I want** to see detailed information about a service when I click its 3D model, **so that** I can learn more about what the agency offers.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    1.  Clicking a 3D model causes a 2D UI element (e.g., a modal) to appear with the correct service information.
    2.  The UI element can be closed to return to the main view.

## 8. Next Steps

#### UX Expert Prompt
Based on this PRD, please create a comprehensive UI/UX Specification (`front-end-spec.md`). Pay close attention to the inspirational examples (`hyperbolic.ai`, `firebase.studio`) and the goal of creating a 'wow factor' through an interactive 3D showcase and real-time personalization.

#### Architect Prompt
Based on this PRD and the upcoming UI/UX Specification, please create a comprehensive Fullstack Architecture Document. The key challenges are ensuring high performance for the interactive 3D elements and building a scalable foundation for the bilingual, Vercel/Cloudflare/Supabase stack.
